### Description

"Extending Underrepresented Realities" seeks to expand the reach of untold stories from underrepresented communities using Web3 and decentralized technologies. Since 2021, the **Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism (CCIJ)** has pioneered immersive, data-driven investigative journalism. Now, we aim to take this further by developing **XR**, **AR**, and **VR** tools that allow audiences to engage with investigative journalism in powerful new ways.

By utilizing **decentralized platforms** like the **Arbitrum One network**, this project offers immersive storytelling, dynamic NFTs, and innovative participation models that bring **community-curated journalism** to a global audience.

Our goal is to:
1. Build decentralized, tokenized investigative journalism platforms.
2. Foster active community involvement through **Quadratic Funding** and **dynamic NFTs**.
3. Ensure **accessibility** and **social impact**, particularly in regions like Africa, where media access and political freedom are often constrained.
