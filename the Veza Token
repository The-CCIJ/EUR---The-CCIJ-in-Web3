The Token of Appreciation for Investigative Journalists (TAIJ) was named to recognize the critical contributions of investigative journalists globally. The purpose behind TAIJ was to serve as a digital token of gratitude and support for those committed to uncovering truth and exposing corruption, often at personal risk.

Purpose and target:

Purpose: TAIJ was designed to both acknowledge and financially support investigative journalists. The token aimed to create an ecosystem where journalists could be rewarded directly by supporters, communities, and partners, fostering a more decentralized funding and recognition system.

Who It’s For: The token was primarily intended for investigative journalists, especially those working on underfunded, challenging, or high-risk stories that might not attract conventional funding but are essential for accountability and transparency.

Meaning: The name "Token of Appreciation" underscores its function as a gesture of gratitude and solidarity. It symbolizes a way to support investigative journalism as a public good, recognizing it as a vital component of democratic societies.

Renamed as the Veza Token in more broadly allignenment with community values and Web3’s ethos of transparency and connection, while still honoring the initial goal of supporting impactful journalism.
